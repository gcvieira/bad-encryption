# bad encryption

As the name suggests this is not an efficient way of encrypting text (it's actually very bad and easy to break) and should not be used in a real application

Altough this is just a sort of playground for me to test different approaches to text encryption, PR's and suggestions are always welcome

# Usage

	javac Encoder.java

Encoding data:

	java Encoder e

Decoding data:

	java Encoder d

you can then just paste (or type) the text you want to encrypt or decrypt and the output will be shown on the screen
